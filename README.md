# WaterTankProblem

This project demonstrates a solution to calculate and visualize the amount of water that can be trapped between bars of varying heights. It leverages HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for both the calculation logic and dynamic SVG rendering.

JavaScript: Utilizes the calculateWaterUnits function to compute the total trapped water by comparing the heights of bars on both sides of each bar in the array. The drawSVG function then dynamically creates SVG elements to visually represent the bars and the trapped water, enhancing the understanding of the calculation through a graphical interface.
HTML: Provides the structure for the input field, calculation button, and result display area, allowing users to input an array of bar heights and see the calculated trapped water and visualization.
CSS: Ensures the visual appeal and usability of the interface, including the layout of the input field, button, and result display, as well as the styling of the SVG elements for clarity.
